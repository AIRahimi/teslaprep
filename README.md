## Before you take delivery, you should:
1.  Watch the [Model 3 walkthrough videos on the support section of Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/support/model-3-videos). These are great at getting you started with the basics and will speed up your handover process
2.  Review the information supplied on the [Tesla Support pages](https://www.tesla.com/support?redirect=no), these go over details on financing, trade ins, vehicle registration, insurance, warranty, etc. Check these pages before asking questions on Facebook, r/teslamotors, etc.
3.  Attend a [Tesla owner orientation event](https://www.tesla.com/events). You will meet other owners and learn lots of handy tips about general ownership, driving and living with the car.
4.  [Get a home charger installed](https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation)). Tesla has [a list of recommended installers](https://www.tesla.com/support/find-an-installer). You can also check [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKiwyWikNs) to do a DIY installation.
5.  [Download and read a copy of the owners manual](https://www.tesla.com/content/dam/tesla/Ownership/Own/Model%203%20Owners%20Manual.pdf). It will come in handy on your phone/computer for when you need it.

*Note: Pointing these out before you leave is important but if you only notice something days later, don't worry. Tesla is known to rectify these issues either immediately or on your next visit to the service center. If you have a car you're not happy taking away that day you have every right to decline the handover until the problems are fixed.*
