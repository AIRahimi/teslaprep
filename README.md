## Before you take delivery, you should:
1.  Watch the [walkthrough videos on the support section of Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/support?redirect=no). These are great at getting you started with the basics and will speed up your handover process
2.  Review the information supplied on the [Tesla Support pages](https://www.tesla.com/support?redirect=no), these go over details on Finance, Trade-In, Registration, Insurance, Warranty and loads more. It's also worth checking these pages before asking questions on Facebook, r/teslamotors, etc.
3.  Attend a [Tesla Owner Orientation Event](https://www.tesla.com/events), you will meet other owners and learn lots of handy tips about the car, driving the car and living with the car.
4.  [Get a home charger installed](FIXME) ([Tesla info page](https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation)). Tesla have [a list of recommended installers](https://www.tesla.com/support/find-an-installer). You can also check [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKiwyWikNs) to do a DIY installation.
5.  [Download and read a copy of the owners manual](https://www.tesla.com/content/dam/tesla/Ownership/Own/Model%203%20Owners%20Manual.pdf). It will come in handy on your phone/computer for when you need it.
6.  Read [What they don't tell you when you buy an electric car](http://10ways.com/save/travel/car/what-they-dont-tell-you-when-you-buy-an-electric-car/9792)
7.  Grab a [decent tire pump](https://www.amazon.com/Audew-Portable-Compressor-Inflator-Inflatables/dp/B0719925K5/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1530650534&sr=8-4&keywords=tire+pump&dpID=515wSUCBeZL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch). It will save you tire wear.

## On delivery day, you should check:
[Master Model 3 Delivery Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gw13-SKi_XQkooBmWKUunrtL6GO-g8PKSJAl1eLPsJU/edit)

*Note: Pointing these out before you leave is important but if you only notice something days later, don't worry. Tesla is known to rectify these issues either immediately or on your next visit to the service center. If you have a car you're not happy taking away that day you have every right to decline the handover until the problems are fixed.*
