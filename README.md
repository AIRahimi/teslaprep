# TeslaPrep
I couldn't find an updated list of resources for the soup-to-nuts process of buying a Model 3, so I made one! This document is adapted from Will Fealey's UK-based [guide](https://fealey.co.uk/tesla/things-to-check-when-you-pick-up-your-tesla/577) on the Model S. It's been Americanized and edited for the Model 3, with many new links and additional resources since Will's was originally written.

## Before you take delivery, you should:
1.  Watch the [Model 3 walkthrough videos on the support section of Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/support/model-3-videos). These are great at getting you started with the basics and will speed up your handover process
2.  Review the information supplied on the [Tesla Support pages](https://www.tesla.com/support?redirect=no), these go over details on financing, trade ins, vehicle registration, insurance, warranty, etc. Check these pages before asking questions on Facebook, r/teslamotors, etc.
3.  Attend a [Tesla owner orientation event](https://www.tesla.com/events). You will meet other owners and learn lots of handy tips about general ownership, driving and living with the car.
4.  [Get a home charger installed](https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation)). Tesla has [a list of recommended installers](https://www.tesla.com/support/find-an-installer). You can also check [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKiwyWikNs) to do a DIY installation.
5.  [Download and read a copy of the owners manual](https://www.tesla.com/content/dam/tesla/Ownership/Own/Model%203%20Owners%20Manual.pdf). It will come in handy on your phone/computer for when you need it.
6.  Read "[What They Don't Tell You When You Buy an Electric Car]"(http://10ways.com/save/travel/car/what-they-dont-tell-you-when-you-buy-an-electric-car/9792)
7.  Grab a [good tire inflator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N224N1U?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAAR8J).
8.  Join the [Tesla Motors Club forum](https://teslamotorsclub.com/).

## On delivery day, you should check:
[Master Model 3 Delivery Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gw13-SKi_XQkooBmWKUunrtL6GO-g8PKSJAl1eLPsJU/edit)

*Note: Pointing these out before you leave is important but if you only notice something days later, don't worry. Tesla is known to rectify these issues either immediately or on your next visit to the service center. If you have a car you're not happy taking away that day you have every right to decline the handover until the problems are fixed.*

### As part of the walkthrough with a Tesla rep, ensure you cover:
1.  [How to charge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bDGjIxmyNo) / [work a supercharger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srLjNqo7r20) / open the charge flap.

14. Your local [service center](https://www.tesla.com/findus/list/services/United%20States) support number.

## After your first drive:
1.  **Keep driving!**
2.  Download [Plugshare](http://plugshare.com/) to find chargers
3.  Go and try a supercharger (also a good excuse for a first drive)
4.  Consider the paint protected with ceramic paint protection, which will help prevent scratches, stone chips, etc.
5.  Install a [dash camera](https://teslatap.com/articles/ultimate-tesla-dashcam-guide/). Many owners opt for the [BlackVue](https://www.blackvue.com/) brand.
6.  Consider alloy wheel insurance or protection.
7.  [Learn how to properly wash your car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWmtLSQYbys)
8.  Be aware the Model 3 does not come with a spare tire.
9. When your registration arrives, check that it's the correct model listed (LR AWD, etc.), as it could affect selling your car in the future, insurance coverage, etc.
10. Respond to the surveys that Tesla periodically sends. This the best way that you can directly impact improvements to the car and company.
